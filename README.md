## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play against another player.
- **AI mode**: Play against the computer (AI).
- **Colored terminal output**: uses `chalk` for a visually enhanced experience.
- **Score tracking**: Scores for both players are tracked across multiple rounds.
- **Replayable**: Players can choose to play another round or change names after each game to reser scores.

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses **`X`**, and Player 2 (or AI) uses **`O`**.
- Players take turns entering their move by specifying a row and column (e.g., `1 3` or `13`).
- The first player to get three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
